# Quantium-Data-Analytics-Job-Simulation

I participated in a job simulation focused on Data Analytics and Commercial Insights, where I developed expertise in using Python for data preparation and customer segmentation. 

During this experience, I worked extensively with transaction datasets to extract valuable insights, which I then used to deliver data-driven commercial recommendations. As part of the simulation, I extended my analytical capabilities by identifying benchmark stores for conducting uplift testing on trial store layouts. This work enabled evidence-based decision-making and contributed to the success of the project. Leveraging the data analytics and insights I acquired, I created a comprehensive report for the Category Manager. This report facilitated informed strategic decisions and enhanced commercial applications, showcasing my ability to apply analytical skills to real-world business challenges.

Findings:
 - For Mainstream Young Singles/Couples, the top brand preferences
 are Doritos, Kettle, and Pringles, with Kettle being the most favored. For Mainstream Midage
 Singles/Couples, the preferred brands include Doritos, Kettle, Pringles, and Smiths, with Kettle
 being the most popular and Doritos coming in second.
 I recommend that Julia increase the stock of Kettle for the Mainstream Young Singles/Couples
 segment, and for the Mainstream Midage Singles/Couples segment, she should stock up on both
 Kettle and Doritos. Additionally, if there is funding available, Julia should consider running a
 targeted campaign focused on Kettle, as it is the most frequently purchased item by both segments.
 This strategy is likely to boost overall sales.
 - For Mainstream Young Singles/Couples, the most popular pack
 sizes are 110g, 134g, 150g, and 175g, with 175g being the top choice. For Mainstream Midage
 Singles/Couples, the favored pack sizes include 110g, 134g, 150g, 170g, 175g, and both 150g and
 175g combined, with 175g being the most popular.
 I suggest that Julia increase the stock of 175g chips, as this size is frequently purchased by both
 segments. If there is available funding, a targeted campaign for 175g chips could further boost
 sales.
 Based on these insights, Julia should also focus on stocking up 175g Kettle chips, as this size is
 frequently bought by the highest spenders. This strategy should help to further enhance overall
 sales
- The combination of trial and control stores are the following: (77, 233), (86, 155) and (88, 237).
    -  This shows that the trial in store 77 is significantly different to its control store in the trial period as the trial store performance lies outside of the 5% to 95% 
confidence interval of the control store in two of the three trial months.
    - The total sales are not statistically different as the trial storeâ€™s total sales are inside of the 5% to 95% confidence interval for two of the three trial months. 
We may need to check with the client if the implementation of the trial was different for this store.
    - This shows that the trial in store 88 is significantly different to its control store in the trial period as the trial store performance lies outside of the 5% to 95% 
confidence interval of the control store in two of the three trial months
